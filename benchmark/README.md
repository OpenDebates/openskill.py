# Benchmark Instructions

Simply run the respective Jupyter Notebook files with a compatible Python version and choose the options.

## Available Benchmarks

- ``win.ipynb``: Compares win performance against TrueSkill.
- ``draw.ipynb``: Predicts draws on standard chess matches.
- ``rank.ipynb``: Uses rank prediction on a large dataset.

Note that the rank benchmark downloads a large file (around 1 GB) and requires slightly more RAM if running locally.
