msgid "You can represent the decay of a player's skill over time by increasing ``sigma`` by a little per match not played (or every time interval). First collect data on by how much sigma goes up or down by resetting sigma to it's default value per interval. The value by which ``sigma`` should change must be an average of the change of ``sigma`` over all matches when ``sigma`` is reset per interval."
